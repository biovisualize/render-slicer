render-queue
============
renderQueue.js is a small utility to chunk rendering using requestAnimationFrame. It comes out of the brain of the mad genius [Syntagmatic](https://github.com/syntagmatic) 
and was released under the WTFPL license. 

Since I use it a lot and find it useful, I thought it deserved a proper home on GitHub, so users can modify it and share. 
My only contribution was to add a unit test suite and some minor mods.

See the [Demo](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/raw/3341641/) for documentation.
